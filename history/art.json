    "content": "Great question — nice detail to add to your canvases. Here are practical places and options in the Netherlands (besides Action), plus quick tips for using it on canvas.\n\nWhere to buy (physical + online)\n- Pipoos (hobby/knutselketen) — good for colored craft sand and small quantities. Webshop + stores.  \n- Van Beek Art Supplies (vanbeekart.com) — pro art materials; they carry texture pastes and sometimes specialty sands.  \n- Gerstaecker (gerstaecker.nl) — large art supply retailer, texture media and additives.  \n- Intratuin (garden center) — decorative gravel/sanded decorative mixes (washed, colored) that work for texture.  \n- Bouwmarkten (Praxis, Gamma, Karwei) — buy washed play sand or fine decorative sand in larger bags (cheap, good for mixes).  \n- Aquarium / pet shops and webshops (e.g., Aquashop, Bol.com listings for “aquariumzand”) — aquarium sand is very clean and fine-grained.  \n- bol.com / Amazon.nl / Etsy — lots of small sellers for colored sand and craft sand in small bags.  \n- Specialty online art stores — search for “texture sand”, “sand gel”, “sand paste”, or “structure paste” (these are pre-mixed, art-friendly options).\n\nProducts to look for (terms to search)\n- “kleurzand” / “knutselzand” / “craft sand”  \n- “speelzand / gewassen zand” (washed play sand)  \n- “aquariumzand” (fine and clean)  \n- “textuurpasta met zand” / “sand texture paste” / “pumice gel” / “structure paste” (ready-to-use mediums)\n\nPractical tips for using sand on canvas\n1. Decide the look: fine vs coarse grain changes the feel — fine sand is subtle, coarse gives gritty texture.  \n2. Prep sand: if buying play or garden sand, rinse and let dry or use “gewassen/washed” bags to reduce dust.  \n3. Adhesion: mix sand into acrylic medium, heavy body gel medium or PVA glue (e.g., 1:1 medium to sand to start). Apply with palette knife. For ready-made ease, use a texture/sand paste from art suppliers.  \n4. Seal: once dry, seal with acrylic varnish to prevent loose grains.  \n5. Safety: wear a dust mask when handling dry sand and work in a ventilated area.\n\nQuick recipe to try right away\n- Mix 1 part fine washed sand + 1 part acrylic gel medium. Test on scrap canvas, let dry, then paint on top. Adjust ratio for more/less texture.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Find 2–3 exact product links (small-bag options or art texture pastes) based on whether you prefer natural, colored, or ultra-fine sand.  \n- Help you plan a short stream/demo showing how you mix and apply sand textures (chat-friendly, cozy format).\n\nWhich look are you going for — subtle grain, beachy/coarse texture, or colored/decorative sand?"
